# Create a user interface
# Use a library such as Flask or Django to create a web interface for the user to input their wallet address
# and view their reputation score and access level.

# For example, using Flask:
from flask import Flask, request
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return '''
    <form method="POST" action="/check_address">
    Wallet address: <input type="text" name="address"><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    '''

@app.route('/check_address', methods=['POST'])
def check_address():
    address = request.form['address']
    access_level = check_access(address)
    reputation_score = get_reputation_score(address)
    return 'Access level: {}<br>Reputation score: {}'.format(access_level, reputation_score)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
